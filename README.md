### Introduction
This project implements a basic lexical analyzer and parser for a simple language called TinyPIe. It includes functionalities to tokenize input source code, perform lexical analysis, parse the tokens, and visualize the parsing tree.

### Features
Tokenization of input source code.
Lexical analysis for identifying tokens.
Parsing the tokens to create a parse tree.
Visualizing the parse tree using a GUI interface.
Supports basic language constructs like if statements, print statements, float and int expressions.

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/JoshuaRemington/LexerWithGui
Navigate to the project directory:
cd lexical-analysis-tinypie
Install the required dependencies: 
pip install tkinter
Usage
Run the main script to launch the GUI application:
python main.py
Input your source code in the left panel of the GUI.
Click on "Next Line" to tokenize the code and visualize the parse tree.
Explore the lexical analysis and parsing results in the respective panels of the GUI.
